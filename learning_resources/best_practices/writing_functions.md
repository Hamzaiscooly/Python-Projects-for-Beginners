# Writing Functions - Quick Notes

- Keep functions short and focused on one task  
- Use descriptive names that explain purpose  
- Avoid side effects; functions should not change outside variables  
- Use default arguments carefully (avoid mutable defaults)  
- Use *args and **kwargs for flexible parameters  
- Document functions with clear docstrings (purpose, args, returns)  
- Return early to reduce nesting and improve readability
