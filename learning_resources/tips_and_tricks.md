- Use with statement to safely open and close files  
- Avoid mutable default arguments in function definitions  
- Use exceptions to handle errors, avoid broad except clauses  
- Write unit tests to verify code correctness  
- Use generators to save memory when processing large data  
- Avoid global variables when possible
