# ðŸ§  Core Python Concepts Explained in Plain English

This file explains fundamental Python ideas in simple terms for beginners.

---

## Variables

Think of variables as labeled boxes where you store data.  
Example:  
```python
age = 25
name = "Alice"
```
## Data Types

Different kinds of data you can store:
```python
int: whole numbers (5, 100)
float: decimal numbers (3.14, 0.5)
str: text ("hello")
bool: True or False
```
## Functions
Reusable chunks of code that do one specific task.
Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
## Loops

Repeat something multiple times.
for loop: repeat a known number of times
while loop: repeat while a condition is true
Conditionals
Make decisions in your code based on conditions.
Example:
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("Too young to vote")
```
## Lists
Ordered collections of items you can change.
Example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```
## Dictionaries
Collections of key-value pairs. Like a mini database.
Example:
```python
student = {"name": "Bob", "age": 21}
```
## Classes and Objects
Blueprints for creating things with attributes and behaviors.
Example:
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Fido")
my_dog.bark()
```
## Modules and Libraries
Pieces of code others wrote that you can reuse.
Example:
```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
