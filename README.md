# 🧪 Python Projects for Beginners

Welcome to the **Python Projects for Beginners** folder! 🎉

This folder is part of a larger effort to help **new Python learners** go beyond the basics and start building real, working programs. Whether you're just starting out or reviewing what you've learned, these mini-projects are designed to be approachable, practical, and fun.

You don’t need advanced Python knowledge — just a basic understanding of:
- Printing text
- Getting user input
- Using variables and simple data types (like strings, lists, and dictionaries)
- Writing functions
- Using if-statements and loops

Each project focuses on one or more beginner-level concepts and gives you a hands-on way to practice and learn.

These are **real projects**, but kept small and simple — so you can:
- Read the code and understand what’s going on
- Run the programs and see how they work
- Experiment with changing things
- Learn new techniques by doing!

If you're learning Python and asking yourself:
> *“How do I start making simple projects”*

This is the place for you! These projects will help build your confidence and teach you how to think like a programmer — step by step.
